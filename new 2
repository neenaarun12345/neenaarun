You have been given an array of size N consisting of integers. In addition you have been given an element M you need to find and print the index of the last occurrence of this element M in the array if it exists in it, otherwise print -1. Consider this array to be 1 indexed.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
int N;
int Number;
int ind=-1;
cin >>N;
int current_Num;

cin >> Number;
for (int i=0;i<N;i++)
{
cin>>current_Num;
// chech here for the given number
if(current_Num==Number)
{
ind=i;
}
}
cout<<ind+1;

return 0;
}
